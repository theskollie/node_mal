I was sent a React project by a potential freelance client and noticed it was triggering this strange obfuscated script on a script in the package.json
Decided to deobfuscate the code.
I was able to get the C2 IP address and no results for the malware detection or search results for the IP.
Came back months later and decided to research the IP and found the below article linking this malware to North Korea.
I like to think I was one of the first to deobfuscate it - See dates on the commits & the article.

Danger Folder contains the original files. Open with caution

Identified as North Korean malware - https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/two-campaigns-by-north-korea-bad-actors-target-job-hunters/
